# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### day 13: January 24, 2017

**today's progress** more javascript functions. 



### day 12: January 22, 2017

**todayy's progress** didn't mean to take two days off in a row, but it was needed considering the political climate we are in. time was needed to be sad, regroup, and re-focus. went back to that lab that was giving me trouble on day 11 and got through it!

**thoughts** i really felt the propblem solving wheels spinning during this lab. the instructions didn't spell out exactly how to solve all of the functions, so that bit of problem solving and trial and error was def a confidence booster.

really slacking on tweeting. well, tweeted a lot this weekend but not about code.<br>

### day 11: January 19, 2017

**today's progress** more progression with javascript! (intro to functions on learn.co)

**thoughts** this was challenging as well and i actually had to sleep on it and come back to it.

didn't tweet about it this day either.<br>
[day 11 blog post to come!]

### day 10: January 18, 2017

**today's progress**: more javascript! (flow control on learn.co)

**thoughts**: oi vey. i struggled with this lab and it felt so good once i figured out what i was doing wrong. it took hours though. just one of those days i guess!

didn't tweet!<br>

### day 9: January 17, 2017

**today's progress**: more svg!

**thoughts**: today, i worked on some vector illustration tutorials for Ai. technically did not code at all today, but i really want to figure out illustrator so i try to fit in some time for it when i can. i thought it was going to be a quick tutorial that would take me and hour or two and then have time later on to code, but i spent most of my evening confused and frustrated.

[day 9 tweet](https://twitter.com/shnsbrn/status/821491022333087745) - didn't exactly tweet about day 9 but i do want to point out how incredibly supportive my partner is. he reminds me daily to keep coding.<br>

### day 8: January 16, 2017

**today's progress**: javascript conditional statements. 

**thoughts**: at first, these statements seem very straightforward. i understand the logic, but then it can easily get messy and feel convuluted (once you make them into a function). planning to take another look at these. as per my tweet, i worked on this late at night so i won't judge myself too harshly here haha.

### day 7: January 15, 2017

**today's progress**: i played around with SVG's today. learning more about how to modify inline svg. 

**thoughts**: i am really wanting to get into illustration as a hobby. coding is very tangible to me, and design never felt that way. i feel that svg and css illustrations incorporate those two things and i'm hoping design can stop being semi scary to me!

**today's progress**: changed my mind about the aforementiond landing page so i started over. also got an idea for a fun side project from a friend and spent time thinking on how to build it out.

### day 3: January 11, 2017

**today's progress**: more javascript in bootcamp prep course. plus some freecodecamp and codecademy exercises. and read some documentation today. 

**thoughts**: i love reading docmentation to futher cement learning. but for some reason ruby isn't clicking with me the way other things have. prob just need to dedicate more time to ruby and from fewer sources.

### day 1: January 9, 2017 

**today's progress**: learned new things about Javascript in Flatiron School's bootcamp prep.

**thoughts**: it's making sense. pretty fascinated about the different data types there are and playing around with examples in the console (which can be accessed in chrome on  mac by selecting 'cmd + option + j'.

### day 0: January 9, 2017 

**today's progress**: working on getting my log and blog set up for 100daysofcode. 

**thoughts**: so far so good, what initially made me nervous about this challenge was having to push to github daily, but with time comes proficiency. I've tinkered on github a few times now, and have been successful in accomplishing what I wanted in the moment but I am hoping to become a lot more comfortable with github soon!

**update**: realized i won't always have personal code to push to github daily, especially when working through an online course/tutorial, but i will make an effort to push all code that is related to a personal project.
