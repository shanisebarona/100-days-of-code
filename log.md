# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Working on getting my log and blog set up for 100daysofcode. 

**Thoughts** So far so good, what initially made me nervous about this challenge was having to push to github daily, but with time comes proficiency. I've tinkered on github a few times now, and have been successful in accomplishing what I wantged in the moment but I am hoping to become a lot more comfortable with github soon!
