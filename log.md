**today's progress**: more portfolio work. back to the template. rolls eyes. 

### day 38, 39, 40: March 7, 8, 9, 2017

**today's progress**: grouping these days together because I mainly plugged away at a portfolio redesign. I get these bursts of inpspiration of wanting to design and build my own portfolio and it last a few days. And then I'm back to ehh, I should probably use a template for now and worry about a redesign when I have more skills. It's a constant back and forth. I annoy myself. 

### day 37: March 6, 2017

**today's progress**: worked on more ruby labs!

### day 36: March 5, 2017

**today's progress**: more ruby and worked through some flexbox demos using cute fruit and a pdf flexbox guide a friend is printing soon!

### day 35: March 4, 2017

**today's progress**: success! finally! back to my ruby module and was able to move past that problem. 

### day 33 & 34: March 1-2 2017

**today's progress**: worked more on the portfolio! using a github repo to host/deploy it. 
 
### day 31 & 32: February 27 & 28 2017

### day 30: February 26, 2017

**today's progress**: Working in the Web Design Udemy course again. Learning more about Photoshop. I plan to get back to my ruby module tonight and pray I get through it. 

### day 29: February 25, 2017

**today's progress**: didn't code today but i did attend a GDI Photoshop 101 class. Photoshop PSD files are key to web design as a lot of web comps are made in photoshop. It's important to me to get a good grasp of it and the PSD to HTML route!

### day 28: February 24, 2017

**today's progress**: while i let that ruby lab marinate, I went back to my Udemy Web Design course. I purchased it awhile ago but I haven't gotten very far and decided to devle into it. My site is due for an overhaul. I want to incorporate a portfolio and design it all myself and I'm hoping I can get that out of this course. 


### day 27: February 23, 2017

**today's progress**: opened my computer, took a look at the next lab in my ruby module and shut my computer. yup oe of those days. (okay it was longer than a look. i read through the lab and opened in the IDE but I was so lost and unsure of where to start, my brain shutdown lol.)

### day 26: February 22, 2017

**today's progress**: learning about CLI applications!

### day 25: February 21, 2017

**today's progress**: tomorrow ended up being a few days, ha. but in better news, i figured out with ruby problem i was having! it was a lab requiring string interpolation to build a tic tac toe board and i was totally overthinking it. 

### day 24: February 17, 2017

**today's progress**: stumped on a ruby problem. spent too much time on it, and decided to step away and try again tomorrow.

### day 15: February 1, 2017

**today's progress**: unintentionally had some time away from coding (again) this time due to GETTING ACCEPTED TO FLATIRON SCHOOL'S WEB DEV PROGRAM. so while i straightened out the fine details of that and was busy with work, unfortunately didn't have time to code until today! 

**thoughts**: incredibly excited about starting this bootcamp!!! ruby is the first thing in the curriculum which is great becuase my exposure to ruby has been very minimal and somewhat furstrasting. i am hoping to have a better understanding of it very soon. 

### day 14: January 25, 2017

**today's progress** updated github with some completed projects and spruced up some old css. 

**thoughts** i barely remember writing the css i wrote for one of my skillcrush projects. spent today cleaning it up, making the breakpoint transitions even smoother and trying to familiarize myself with using css to make a responsive site. 

### day 13: January 24, 2017

**today's progress** more javascript functions. 

**thoughts** these functions, man, woof. 


### day 12: January 22, 2017

**todayy's progress** didn't mean to take two days off in a row, but it was needed considering the political climate we are in. time was needed to be sad, regroup, and re-focus. went back to that lab that was giving me trouble on day 11 and got through it!

**thoughts** i really felt the propblem solving wheels spinning during this lab. the instructions didn't spell out exactly how to solve all of the functions, so that bit of problem solving and trial and error was def a confidence booster.

really slacking on tweeting. well, tweeted a lot this weekend but not about code.<br>
[day 12 blog post coming soon]


### day 11: January 19, 2017

**today's progress** more progression with javascript! (intro to functions on learn.co)

**thoughts** this was challenging as well and i actually had to sleep on it and come back to it.

**links**<br>
didn't tweet about it this day either.<br>
[day 11 blog post to come!]

### day 10: January 18, 2017

**today's progress**: more javascript! (flow control on learn.co)

**thoughts**: oi vey. i struggled with this lab and it felt so good once i figured out what i was doing wrong. it took hours though. just one of those days i guess!

**links**<br>
didn't tweet!<br>
[day 10 blog post coming soon]

### day 9: January 17, 2017

**today's progress**: more svg!

**thoughts**: today, i worked on some vector illustration tutorials for Ai. technically did not code at all today, but i really want to figure out illustrator so i try to fit in some time for it when i can. i thought it was going to be a quick tutorial that would take me and hour or two and then have time later on to code, but i spent most of my evening confused and frustrated.

[day 9 tweet](https://twitter.com/shnsbrn/status/821491022333087745) - didn't exactly tweet about day 9 but i do want to point out how incredibly supportive my partner is. he reminds me daily to keep coding.<br>

### day 8: January 16, 2017

**today's progress**: javascript conditional statements. 

**thoughts**: at first, these statements seem very straightforward. i understand the logic, but then it can easily get messy and feel convuluted (once you make them into a function). planning to take another look at these. as per my tweet, i worked on this late at night so i won't judge myself too harshly here haha.

### day 7: January 15, 2017

**today's progress**: i played around with SVG's today. learning more about how to modify inline svg. 

**thoughts**: i am really wanting to get into illustration as a hobby. coding is very tangible to me, and design never felt that way. i feel that svg and css illustrations incorporate those two things and i'm hoping design can stop being semi scary to me!

didnt' tweet about day 7. woops. <br>

**today's progress**: changed my mind about the aforementiond landing page so i started over. also got an idea for a fun side project from a friend and spent time thinking on how to build it out.

**thoughts**: one of my goals this year is to build little side projects so i'm glad to colloborate with a friend on this idea! i share more in depth thoughts in today's blog post.

### day 3: January 11, 2017

**today's progress**: more javascript in bootcamp prep course. plus some freecodecamp and codecademy exercises. and read some documentation today. 

**thoughts**: i love reading docmentation to futher cement learning. but for some reason ruby isn't clicking with me the way other things have. prob just need to dedicate more time to ruby and from fewer sources.

### day 1: January 9, 2017 

**today's progress**: learned new things about Javascript in Flatiron School's bootcamp prep.

**thoughts**: it's making sense. pretty fascinated about the different data types there are and playing around with examples in the console (which can be accessed in chrome on  mac by selecting 'cmd + option + j'.

### day 0: January 9, 2017 

**today's progress**: working on getting my log and blog set up for 100daysofcode. 

**thoughts**: so far so good, what initially made me nervous about this challenge was having to push to github daily, but with time comes proficiency. I've tinkered on github a few times now, and have been successful in accomplishing what I wanted in the moment but I am hoping to become a lot more comfortable with github soon!

**update**: realized i won't always have personal code to push to github daily, especially when working through an online course/tutorial, but i will make an effort to push all code that is related to a personal project.
