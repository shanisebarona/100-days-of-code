### day 3: January 11, 2017

**today's progress**: more javascript in bootcamp prep course. plus some freecodecamp and codecademy exercises. and read some documentation today. 

**thoughts**: i love reading docmentation to futher cement learning. but for some reason ruby isn't clicking with me the way other things have. prob just need to dedicate more time to ruby and from fewer sources.

### day 1: January 9, 2017 

**today's progress**: learned new things about Javascript in Flatiron School's bootcamp prep.

**thoughts**: it's making sense. pretty fascinated about the different data types there are and playing around with examples in the console (which can be accessed in chrome on  mac by selecting 'cmd + option + j'.

### day 0: January 9, 2017 

**today's progress**: working on getting my log and blog set up for 100daysofcode. 

**thoughts**: so far so good, what initially made me nervous about this challenge was having to push to github daily, but with time comes proficiency. I've tinkered on github a few times now, and have been successful in accomplishing what I wanted in the moment but I am hoping to become a lot more comfortable with github soon!

**update**: realized i won't always have personal code to push to github daily, especially when working through an online course/tutorial, but i will make an effort to push all code that is related to a personal project.
